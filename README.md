# ISOLATED MATRIX MULTIPLICATION - COMMIT 

This repository contains the isolated code of the matrix multiplication done in COMMIT. It's part of the work I'm doing for my thesis in my master degree.
The goal is to try new data structures and implementations to reach a better performance than the original implementation. 
Each branch of this repo is a different approach.
